## Overview
This project implements a **secure communication logic** using two classical cryptographic techniques: **Vigenère cipher** and **Polybius square**. It focuses on encrypting and decrypting messages on the command line to ensure confidentiality.

## Features
- **Vigenère Cipher**: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
- **Polybius Square**: A cipher that replaces each letter with a pair of coordinates.

## How It Works
- **Vigenère Cipher**: It takes a keyword and the plaintext as input, and produces the encrypted text by shifting characters based on the keyword.
- **Polybius Square**: It transforms letters into coordinate pairs, based on a 5x5 grid, where each letter corresponds to a specific set of coordinates.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Command-line interface (CLI) access.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd secure-communication
    ```
3. Run the encryption or decryption logic from the command line:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Encryption Example
To encrypt a message using Vigenère Cipher:
```bash
$ python secure_communication.py encrypt --message "HELLO" --key "KEY"
Encrypted Message: "RIJVS"
To decrypt using Vigenère Cipher:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
$ python secure_communication.py decrypt --message "RIJVS" --key "KEY"
Decrypted Message: "HELLO"
Polybius Square Example
The Polybius Square encryption logic converts letters into coordinates. For example:

bash
Always show details

Copy code
$ python polybius.py encrypt --message "HELLO"
Encrypted Message: "23 15 31 31 34"
Technologies Used
Python: The core logic for encryption and decryption is implemented in Python.
Vigenère Cipher: Classical cryptography technique.
Polybius Square: Grid-based cipher for encryption.
